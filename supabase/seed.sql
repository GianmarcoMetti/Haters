-- Seed file for local development
-- This file is run after migrations during `supabase db reset`

-- Note: Auth users are created through the application signup flow
-- This file can be used to seed additional data for testing

-- Example: Insert test data once migrations are complete
-- You can add sample social accounts, comments, flags, etc. here for testing

-- For now, this file is intentionally minimal
-- Add seed data as needed during development
